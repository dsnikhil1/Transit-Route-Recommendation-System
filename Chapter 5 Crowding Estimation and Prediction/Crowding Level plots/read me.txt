Target: To get the crowding level on the link connecting two stages
Background: Based on the boardings and alightings at each stage, occupancy is calculated according to the state space equation and crowding level is assigned based on the occupancy (column named 'crowd')

Input: Merged ticket data file of 3-11-2016, manually ordered stages file in CSV format for the selected route, source name, destination name
Output: Crowding Level plot for all trips on 3-11-2016 between the selected origin and destination

Scope: If we change the origin and destination, we should also change the stages ordered file. We should also check for the stage names in the stages ordered file. Crowding Level defined as:

Low: crowd <= 30 .....> crowding level defined as 0 (Green color)
Medium: crowd > 30 and crowd <= 40 ...........> crowding level defined as 1 (Blue color)
High: crowd > 40 ...............> crowding level defined as 2 (Red color)
